## About me
I am an aspiring Software Tester with ISTQB Foundation Level certificate. I have completed the "Software Tester'' training and for last two years
gained testing skills by working for an international client's financial application. I can thoroughly search for bugs, write test cases and create User Stories. I am searching for opportunities to gain more advanced professional experience in testing. My career interests are linked to UX/UI and accessibility testing as it is important for me to include all social groups into technology. I can co-operate effectively in project communities as I have been working in both Polish and multicultural teams.
On this site I would like to share my experience from personal studies and researches.
